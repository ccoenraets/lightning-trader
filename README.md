    npm install
    ```

    ```
    npm run build-client
    ```
    
    The project is written using ECMAScript 6 including ECMAScript 6 modules.

    ```
    
1. Open a browser and access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)    

## Using the Socket.io Feed

By default the application uses a mock feed simulated at the client-side. To use the actual Socket.io feed: 

1. Open js/app.js

1. Comment out the module import for the mock client-side feed:

    ```
    // import * as feed from './services/feed-mock';
    ```
    
1. Uncomment the module import for the real socket.io feed:

    ```
    import * as feed from './services/feed-socketio';
    ```
    
1. Rebuild the client:    

    ```
    npm run build-client
    ```
